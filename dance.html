                    Dance is an art form, consisting of sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value, either
                    improvised or purposefully selected. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of
                    movements or by its historical period or place of origin. Dance is typically performed with musical accompaniment, and
                    sometimes with the dancer simultaneously using a musical instrument themselves.

                Two common types of group dance are theatrical and participatory dance. Both types of dance may have special functions,
                whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, sacred or liturgical. Dance is not solely restricted to
                performance, as dance is used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and activities. Dance
                performances and dancing competitions are found across the world exhibiting various different styles and standards.
                
                Dance may also be participated in alone as a form of exercise or self expression. Dancing is common human behaviour, and
                does not necessarily require specific choreography.
